\chapter{psi46test}

This software package is mainly targeted to chip and module testing at low levels. For more detector driven aspects consider using \texttt{psi46expert}.

\section{Basic chip test}

\section{Command reference}
\subsection{Power and chip control}
\begin{description}
    \cmditem{pon}{} %Power on

    Turns on the power currents $VD$ and $VA$ for the chip/module and activates the signals.
    \cmditem{poff}{}%Power off

    Safely turns off the power currents for the chip/module and inactivates the signals. Does not turn off the bias voltage.

\end{description}

\subsection{DTB information}
\begin{description}
    \cmditem{rpcinfo}{} Prints list of RPC functions

    This shows a list of all RPC function the installed firmware supports. Check this for debugging purposes.
\end{description}

\subsection{Analog signals}
\begin{description}
    \cmditem{showclk}{} %Show a oscilloscope view of the CLK signal

    Displays the CLK signal vs. time. No adjustments can be made. Shows it in a graphics window separated from the terminal. Caution: alters settings for timing and signal routing.
    \cmditem{showctr}{}

    Displays the calibrate--trigger--reset sequence of signals vs. time. No adjustments can be made. Shows it in a graphics window separated from the terminal. Caution: alters settings for timing, signal generator and signal routing.
    \cmditem{showsda}{bla} %

    Displays the analog data SDATA1 showing a pixel readout. No adjustments can be made. Shows it in a graphics window separated from the terminal. Caution: alters settings for timing, signal generator and signal routing.
