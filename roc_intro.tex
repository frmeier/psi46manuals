The digital CMS pixel chip, colloquially called \glsreset{ROC}\gls{ROC}, consists of 52$\times$80~pixels. Electrically they are organized in 26 double columns, each having 2$\times$80~pixels. One double column is controlled by a periphery which has buffers for time-stamps and data. There are 24~time-stamp buffers (8~bit wide) and 80~data buffers, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ROCimage}

The periphery and the supply pads are in charge to handle trigger information, buffer data of recent pixel data and handle the communication with the outer world.}
