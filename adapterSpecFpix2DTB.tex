\chapter{Introduction}

This board allows to connect FPix modules (Phase-I upgrade) using a flex cable to connect it to the DTB. Its key features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the proper electrical connections between the TBM of the module and the DTB. This includes matching the impedances.
    \item Provide pass-through for the supply voltages to power the module.
    \item Provide a resistor bridge for measuring the temperature of the HDI using its RTD and two ADC channels in the DTB.
    \item Has an 2\,kbit EEPROM to identify the type of adapter, connected to the DTB via its \isqc{} bus.
    \item Can be mounted on a PSI cold box in a configuration of four boards.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Design considerations}
The board has been designed as a 4-layer PCB with the following topology:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
	\toprule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Layer & Description \\
	\midrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Top & Main signal layer \\
2nd & GND plane \\
3rd & Power plane, distributes \emph{VA}, \emph{VD}, and \emph{HV} \\
Bottom & Remaining signals \\
	\bottomrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Signal routing}

The signal connections between the TBM and the DTB are as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcll}
    \toprule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TBM & direction & DTB & Comments \\
    \midrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \texttt{OutA}        & $\rightarrow$ & \texttt{SDATA1} & \\
    \texttt{RDa\_Out}    & $\rightarrow$ & \texttt{TOUT}   & \\
    \texttt{SD\_In}      & $\leftarrow$  & \texttt{SDA}    & \\
    \texttt{Trig\_In}    & $\leftarrow$  & \texttt{CTR}    & \\
    \texttt{Clk\_In}     & $\leftarrow$  & \texttt{CLK}    & \\
    \texttt{RClk\_Out}   & $\rightarrow$ & \texttt{SDATA3} & Not for regular use. Some TBM versions may not provide it. \\
    \texttt{160MHz\_Out} & $\rightarrow$ & \texttt{SDATA4} & Not for regular use. Some TBM versions may not provide it. \\
    \bottomrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The two signals \texttt{RClk\_Out} and \texttt{160MHz\_Out} are for testing purposes in some versions of the TBM. Connecting them to \texttt{SDATA3} or \texttt{SDATA4} allows to study the clock behaviour using the 400\,MHz deserializer, which internally uses 8-times oversampling.

\section{Impedance matching of TBM signals}

The impedances of the two outer connections are not the same:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
    \toprule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Connection & Impedance $Z$ \\
    \midrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SCSI 68 pin & 115\,$\Omega$ \\
    SMK flex cable & 60\,$\Omega$ \\
    \bottomrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The impedance matching is done following a proposal by Beat Meier of PSI and is sketched out in Fig.~\ref{fig:mpedmatch}. The values calculated are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
    \toprule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Resistor & value \\
    \midrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    $R_1$ & 39\,$\Omega$ \\
    $R_2$ & 91\,$\Omega$ \\
    \bottomrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This choice of resistors are available in the E24 series and lead to the following differential impedances:
\begin{equation}
Z_1 = 2R_1 + \frac{1}{1/R_2 + 1/Z_2} = 115\,\Omega
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
Z_2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2R_1+Z_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}} = 62\,\Omega
\end{equation}
which is well within a few \% of the target impedances.

The dimensions of the traces on the board were calculated using the PCBcalc app provided by Agilent. The values have been chosen as:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Parameter & Case 115\,$\Omega$ & Case 60\,$\Omega$ \\
    \midrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Dielectric constant $\epsilon_r$ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{4.20 (FR-4)} \\
    $h$ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{11.90\,mil (0.30\,mm)} \\
    $t$ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{1.70\,mil (0.043\,mm)} \\
    $w$ & 8.2\,mil (0.21\,mm) & 27\,mil (0.68\,mm) \\
    $s$ & 7.0\,mil (0.18\,mm) & 7.0\,mil (0.18\,mm) \\
    \bottomrule %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The given values $\epsilon_r$, $h$ and $t$ were taken from the supplier (Sunstone circuits). The other values were chosen on practical reasons, where $w$ has been chosen to be a bit larger than the smallest distance the supplier recommends and $s$ follows from the calculation.

\end{figure}


\section{RTD bridge}
Current versions of the HDI have a Pt10000 RTD for measuring the temperature. A circuit proposed by Sergey Los is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RTDcircuit}. This circuit is included and hooked up to two ADC channels of the DTB available on the SCSI connector.

	\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{img/RTDcircuit.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{RTD circuit. Two ADC channels are used for measuring the voltage of the RTD and 3.3\,V channel. The latter is used as a reference. The resolution is estimated to be $2\,^\circ$C.}
	\label{fig:RTDcircuit}
\end{figure}


\section{Form factor}

The size of the board are driven by the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The PSI coldbox takes up to four modules, spaced by 60\,mm. The flex cables will therefore come out of the cold volume in the same spacing (center to center).
    \item The SCSI connectors come in a width of 64\,mm. This is wider than the spacing just mentioned. This requires to turn them by 90$^\circ$ and direct the SCSI cable perpendicular to the flex cables.
    \item The SMK connector needs to be close enough to the flex cable end, which sticks out of the cold volume by just 40\,mm.
    \item The height level of the SMK connector should match the height of the insulation lid of the cold volume.
\end{itemize}
All this lead to the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dimension of 40 $\times$ 140\,mm$^2$
    \item No parts on the bottom side of the board
    \item SMK connector within less than 20\,mm of the edge towards the cold volume
\end{itemize}

\section{HV protection}
High voltage is supplied via the DTB\footnote{The DTB has a relay to control HV from a HV power supply and passes it via a 100\,k$\Omega$ resistor to the SCSI cable. See the DTB documentation about its HV safety.}. The following measures have been taken:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The HV is routed entirely in an inner layer.
    \item There are some spots on the board where a HV is exposed:
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item HV pin at the SCSI connector (pin 68). Accessible on the back of the board.
    
	This pin can be covered by Kapton foil, mounted by Kapton tape
	\item Two vias around the SMK connector.
    
	Can be covered with Kapton as well
	\item Four pins on the SMK connector.
    
	These pins are hard to touch if the connector is closed (which is assumes to be the standard situation when HV is on). No special protection needed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Other requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All differential signals should be accessible as spy pads, preferrably on the chip side for debugging. For a later version of the board, this requirements may be dropped in favour of less parasitic capacitance.
    \item In the same spirit, the power voltages and the RTD signals should be available as well.
    \item Mounting holes should be placed at appropriate locations.
    \item Two holes in the vicinity of the SMK connector should be placed to mount an optional cable guide and/or strain relief.
    \item If tracing of TBM signals cannot be made without using vias, less important signals like the return clocks should be taken for this. In any case, vias in differential signals will be applied in pairs.
\end{itemize}
